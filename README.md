# Todo Web Application

A simple and interactive Todo web application built using Python and Streamlit. This app allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Add new tasks to your todo list.
- Check off completed tasks to mark them as finished.
- Intuitive and responsive design for easy usage.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for backend logic.
- **Streamlit**: A powerful framework to build web applications for machine learning and data science projects.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on [Streamlit]([https://streamlit.io/](https://arireal-my-todo-web-app-web-app-yuez5x.streamlit.app/)), making it accessible from anywhere with an internet connection. You can find the live version [here](your-deployed-url).

## Usage

1. **Adding Tasks**: To add a new task, simply type your activity into the text box located below the task list and press Enter.
2. **Marking Tasks as Complete**: Check the box next to the tasks you have completed to mark them as finished.

## Future Improvements

While the current version of the application serves its purpose, there are several areas for improvement:

- **User Authentication**: Implementing JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to enable user authentication for personalized task management.
- **Task Prioritization**: Adding functionality to prioritize tasks, helping users to focus on whatâ€™s most important.

## Experience Reflection

This project showcases my experience in building interactive applications and integrating user interfaces with back-end logic. I aim to further enhance its impact by deploying it to the cloud (e.g., Heroku or AWS) and improving its functionality.
